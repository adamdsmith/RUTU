To run the analysis:

1. Fork or download this repository; all code and data is available in this repository
2. If necessary, extract the zipped repository to the desired location on your local machine.
3. Open the `RUTU.Rproj` file in [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) on a computer with internet access; RStudio requires [R](http://www.r-project.org) to be installed. This opens the RStudio project associated with the data, code, and analysis.
4. All of the code necessary to process, analyze, and generate figures is located in the `Code` directory. Open and begin by running the code within `00_Process_RUTU_Motus_data.R`. Proceed sequentially through other similarly-named files. If interested only in the figures, these are provided as a convenience in the `Output` directory.
